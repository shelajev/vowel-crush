# Vowel Crush

A fast-paced browser game where you tap the right letters before they fly (or fall) away.

## Features

- Two game modes: hunt vowels or crush consonants.
- Level system with gentle rainbow gradients, automatic speed ups, and level restarts after three mistakes.
- Dual flight styles — **Fountain** (Fruit-Ninja style arcs from the corners) and **Rain** (classic falling letters) — switchable mid-game.
